There are several ways to get into contact, ask questions, contribute, and share your experience regarding roboquant.

== icon:users[1x] Discord
Roboquant has its own Discord server with various channels to discuss algo-trading in general and to get help on developing your own strategies using the roboquant platform.

Since the roboquant documentation is still lacking in certain areas, this is a great place to ask questions and find out more about the platform.
