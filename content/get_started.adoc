There are two different ways to use roboquant and develop trading strategies:

. Interactively in a _Jupyter Notebook_. If you want to be up and running quickly, this is the easiest approach. Additionally, you get many charts out-of-the-box that help you to understand how the strategy is performing.

. As a library in your _standalone Kotlin or Java application_. If you plan to develop large and complex trading strategies, this is a good approach since you'll have the full power of an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA at your disposal.

== Install Jupyter Notebook

If you have already Docker installed on your local machine, all it takes is a single command to have a fully functional Jupyter Notebook environment available.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter
----

By default, this will start a new Jupyter-Lab environment and disposes of it as soon as you stop the container. The installation comes with several tutorial notebooks included that demonstrate how to develop and run your own strategies.

If you don't have Docker yet installed on your computer, check out https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker get started] and download Docker for Desktop from there. If you are running Linux, then your distribution likely already has Docker or Podman included.

If you don't want to install anything locally, you can use a publicly hosted environment:

* Launch the notebooks right now on MyBinder.org by clicking image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/tutorials]
* Go to https://datalore.jetbrains.com/[JetBrains Datalore]. It has excellent support for Kotlin notebooks and has a free tier available if you just want to try roboquant out.

== Install a module
Just add `roboquant` as a dependency to your build tool, like Maven or Gradle. Regular versions of the Roboquant modules are published to Maven Central and snapshots are published to OSS Sonatype (https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).

The following modules are available for inclusion in your application:

* `roboquant`: the core module of the platform image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant[Maven Central]
* `roboquant-crypto`: support for many of today's popular crypto exchanges image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant-crypto?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant-crypto[Maven Central]
* `roboquant-extra`: integrations with 3rd party brokers and market data providers image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant-extra?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant-extra[Maven Central]
* `roboquant-ibkr`: integration with Interactive Brokers image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant-ibkr?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant-ibkr[Maven Central]
* `roboquant-ta`: over 150 technical analysis indicators and strategies image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant-ta?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant-ta[Maven Central]
* `roboquant-jupyter` additional Jupyter Notebook functionality like charting image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant-jupyter?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)] image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant-jupyter[Maven Central]

=== Maven
Add the following snippet to your pom.xml file in the dependencies section:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.roboquant</groupId>
    <artifactId>roboquant</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle
Include the following line in your build.gradle script:

[source]
----
implementation group: 'org.roboquant', name: 'roboquant', version: 'VERSION'
----

== Building from source
First start with cloning the roboquant GitHub repository to your local disk. The quickest way to be up and running is then to install IntelliJ IDEA (either the free community edition or the paid Ultimate version) and open the directory you just cloned. IntelliJ IDEA will recognize it as Kotlin/Maven project, and you can build it and run test directly from the IDE.

You can also use command line tools. Roboquant uses a setup and directory structure that removes much of the ceremony
often found in many Java/Kotlin projects. So no need to go 10 directories deep to locate the source file you were
looking for. 

Roboquant uses (for the time being) Maven for the build process. So if you want to build the libraries from source, you can issue the following command from the project root (assuming you have Maven already installed):

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----
