== Two approaches
There are two different ways to install and use _roboquant_:

. Interactively in a *Jupyter Notebook*. If you want to be up and running quickly, this is the easiest approach. Also, if you are less experienced software developer, this is a good starting point. Additionally, you get many charts out-of-the-box that help you to understand how the strategy is performing.

. As a library in your *standalone Kotlin or Java application*. If you plan to develop large and complex trading strategies, this is a good approach since you'll have the full power of an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA at your disposal.

== Install Jupyter Notebook
If you have already Docker installed on your local machine, all it takes is a single command to have a fully functional Jupyter Notebook environment available that is ready to use.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter
----

By default, this will start a new Jupyter-Lab environment and disposes of it as soon as you stop the container. The installation comes with several how-to notebooks included that demonstrate how to develop and run your own strategies.

If you don't have Docker yet installed on your computer, check out https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker get started] and download Docker for Desktop from there. If you are running Linux, then your distribution likely already has Docker or Podman included.

If you don't want to install anything locally, you can use a publicly hosted notebook environment:

* Launch the notebooks right now on MyBinder.org by clicking image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/tutorials,window=_blank]
* Go to https://datalore.jetbrains.com/[JetBrains Datalore]. It has excellent support for Kotlin notebooks and has a free tier available if you just want to try _roboquant_ out.

== Install the _roboquant_ library
Just add `roboquant` as a dependency to your build tool, like Maven or Gradle. Regular versions of the Roboquant modules are published to Maven Central and snapshots are published to OSS Sonatype (https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).

The latest available versions:

- regular release: image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.roboquant/roboquant[Maven Central]
- snapshot release: image:https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/org.roboquant/roboquant?server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)]

The following modules are available for inclusion in your application:

* `roboquant`: the core module of the platform
* `roboquant-crypto`: support for many of today's popular crypto exchanges
* `roboquant-extra`: integrations with 3rd party brokers and market data providers
* `roboquant-ibkr`: integration with Interactive Brokers
* `roboquant-ta`: over 150 technical analysis indicators and strategies
* `roboquant-jupyter` additional Jupyter Notebook functionality like charting

=== Maven
Add the following snippet to your pom.xml file in the dependencies section:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.roboquant</groupId>
    <artifactId>roboquant</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Gradle
Include the following line in your build.gradle script:

[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'org.roboquant', name: 'roboquant', version: 'VERSION'
----

== Building from source
First start with cloning the _roboquant_ GitHub repository to your local disk. The quickest way to be up and running is then to install IntelliJ IDEA (either the free community edition or the paid Ultimate version) and open the directory you just cloned. IntelliJ IDEA will recognize it as Kotlin/Maven project, and you can build it and run test directly from the IDE.

You can also use a plain text editor of course. Roboquant uses a setup and directory structure that removes much of the ceremony often found in many Java/Kotlin projects. So no need to go 10 directories deep to locate the source file you were looking for.

Roboquant uses Maven for the build process and assuming you already have this installed, building the libraries locally, is as easy as:

[source, shell]
----
mvn build
----

The build and install is tested using JDK 17 runtime, however the generated libraries are targeted against JDK 11 in order to provide greater compatibility for projects that still use older versions of the JDK.

TIP: If you plan to make many changes and updates to the source code, checkout the https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd[Maven Daemon] project that provides much faster builds.

== Interactive Brokers
Unfortunately we are not allowed to redistribute the Interactive Brokers Java client, so you'll have to download the TwsApi.jar file yourself. You can download version `10.15` from here: https://interactivebrokers.github.io/# and within the downloaded archive file you'll find the required `TwsApi.jar`.

Then install the jar file in the local Maven repository on your machine using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=TwsApi.jar -DgroupId=com.interactivebrokers -DartifactId=tws-api -Dversion=10.15 -Dpackaging=jar
----

If this artefact cannot be found in your local Maven repository during a build, the module `roboquant-ibkr` will automatically be skipped. So if you don't require integration with Interactive Brokers for your trading, you can skip this step.
