A `Strategy` is likely the place where you do most software development. It is responsible for generating signals based on the events it receives.

Since a `Strategy` only has access to an `Event` and not an `Account`, it has no knowledge of concepts like orders, open positions or buying power. As a consequence a `Stategy` is a generic component that can be easily shared or re-used if required.

== Standard Strategies
There are several commonly used strategies included with roboquant.

=== EMACrossover
Uses two exponential moving averages and whenever they cross over a BUY or SELL signal is generated

=== TAStrategy
TAStrategy is short for Technical Analysis Strategy and is a convenient way of using the `ta-lib` indicators in a strategy by defining the BUY and/or SELL condition.

The `ta-lib` comes with over 200 indicators and these can be combined anyway you like in a TAStrategy.

=== RSIStrategy
Strategy using the Relative Strength Index of an asset to generate signals. RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.

If the RSI raise above the configured high threshold (default 70), a sell signal will be generated. And if the RSI falls below the configured low threshold (default 30), a buy signal will be generated.

=== NoSignalStrategy
This strategy doesn't perform any action and will never generate a signal. If you develop all your logic in a Policy and don't require a strategy, use this strategy when you create a `Roboquant` instance. See also <<_policy_based_strategies>>


== Combining Strategies
The `Roboquant` constructor takes only a single strategy as its parameter. However, it is easy to combine multiple strategies in your using a simple composition pattern.

== Extending Strategies
Next to the standard strategies, there are also strategies that can be the foundation for your own strategy. You extend these classes and add your own logic on top of them. These base strategies typically take care of some repetitive task and make it a quicker to develop your own strategies.

A useful base strategies is `HistoricPriceStrategy`. This strategy collects historic prices for a predefined look-back period before invoking your method.

== Custom Strategies
When you develop your own `Strategy`, you will need to implement at least the `generate` method that is defined in the `Strategy` interface. This method should return zero or more Signals.

Now let's see how a trend-following `Strategy` would look like that would:

- generate a BUY-signal every time the current price is more than 5% higher than the previous price for a given `Asset`
- and a SELL-signal if it is more than 5% lower

As you can see a Strategy can maintain state, the `previousPrices` in the above example.You have to ensure you reset the state when a `Component` lifecycle event is called, like the `start` method in the above example.


[#_policy_based_strategies]
== Policy based Strategies
There are use cases that require a strategy not only to have access to the event but also to the account.These type of strategies can be implemented in roboquant, but they should be implemented as a policy and not strategy.Some reasons you might want to use a policy:

* Access to the Account instance is required, for example to re-balance a portfolio
* Directly generate orders instead of signals

See the xref:policy.adoc[policy documentation] for more details.


== Signals

A signal is the outcome of a strategy and is modelled closely after the ratings given by ratings agencies. The two mandatory parts of a signal are:

1. The asset that the signal applies for
2. A rating for that same asset

There is a 5-point scale used for the rating part of a signal:

* Buy: Also known as strong buy and "on the recommended list". Buy is a recommendation to purchase a specific security.
* Sell: Also known as strong sell, it's a recommendation to sell a security or to liquidate an asset.
* Hold: In general terms, a company with a hold recommendation is expected to perform at the same pace as comparable companies or in-line with the market.
* Underperform: A recommendation that means a stock is expected to do slightly worse than the overall stock market return. Underperform can also be expressed as "moderate sell," "weak hold" and "underweight."
* Outperform: Also known as "moderate buy," "accumulate" and "overweight." Outperform is an analyst recommendation meaning a stock is expected to do slightly better than the market return.

NOTE: a hold rating is not the same as no signal. Only generate hold signals if you think the asset will perform market conform. If your strategy has no idea about the performance of an asset, don't generate a signal at all.


== Simple Signals

[source, kotlin]
----
    // apple is of the type Asset
    val signal = Signal(apple, Rating.BUY)
----

== Advanced Signals
Besides the mandatory Rating and Asset, a signal can optionally contain the following attributes (with their default values):

    val asset: Asset,
    val rating: Rating,
    val type: SignalType = SignalType.BOTH,
    val takeProfit: Double = Double.NaN,
    val stopLoss: Double = Double.NaN,
    val probability: Double = Double.NaN,
    val source: String = ""

It is up to the xref:../policy/index.adoc[policy] how to use these attributes when generating the orders.
