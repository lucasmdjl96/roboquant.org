Welcome to the roboquantâ„¢ tutorial. Just like the _roboquant_ software, the documentation is also open source. So if you find mistakes or want to contribute, head over to the https://github.com/neurallayer/roboquant.org[GitHub documentation repository] where you can find the source.

== Reading Guide
You can select any item from the menu to get more information about that topic. Content that is formatted like `SomeName`, represents a real Kotlin class, interface, method or attribute. The package name is typically omitted. All the used code snippets are compilable and runnable code. However, the required import statements are not shown to improve readability.

== Main components
Perhaps the most important part of using _roboquant_ is to understand the sequence of steps and the responsibility each component has in this flow. The following diagram provides an overview of the main components and the type of data they consume and produce.

The role and responsibilities of each of the components are as follows:

* `Roboquant`
+
The engine of the platform that performs the actual run and orchestrate the interaction between the components. The engine supports all xref:../background/four_stages.adoc[4 stages] of developing a trading strategy with minimal changes to your code. This is also the only component that is a concrete Class and not an Interface and not designed to be swapped out for a custom implementation.

*  `Feed`
+
Provides the data needed for testing and trading in the form of events. A feed can represent both historic and live data and is not restricted to pricing information only. A feed delivers its data in the form of events.

* `Broker`
+
Receives the created orders by the policy and process them. Any open orders will be processed until they are closed. After this step, it will return an updated account that reflects the latest state.

* `Metric`
+
Receives the latest state of the account and calculates various metrics that are of interest to determine the progress and results of the run so far.

* `MetricsLogger`
+
Stores and/or logs the metric values, so you can inspect them at a later time.

* `Strategy`
+
Receives the event and generates zero or more signals. A signal is a rating for a certain asset, like a BUY rating for stock XYZ. So the strategy doesn't create orders, that is the responsibility of the next component, the policy.

* `Policy`
+
Receives the generated signals and creates the orders. If you need to create orders that are not based on signals, this is also the place to do so, for example re-balance your portfolio at regular intervals. Check the xref:../background/features.adoc#_order_management[features] why it is smart to separate this from your strategy logic.

== Developing your strategy
Developing a new strategy and validate it during a back-test is a straight forward process. The code snippet below shows the different steps that you have to take to develop and run your strategy.

[source, kotlin,  subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
class MyStrategy : Strategy { // <1>
    override fun generate(event: Event): List<Signal> {
        // your code goes here
    }
}

val strategy = MyStrategy() // <2>
val metric = AccountSummary() //<3>
val roboquant = Roboquant(strategy, metric) //<4>

val feed = CSVFeed("./data/us") //<5>
roboquant.run(feed) //<6>
----
<1> Develop a new strategy based on some idea you have. This can be done either from scratch or by assembling existing building blocks. In many cases, this is the only real software development required. See also xref:strategy.adoc[Strategy] for more details.
<2> Create an instance of your strategy.
<3> Instantiate the metrics you want to use to evaluate the performance of your strategy.
<4> Create an instance of Roboquant (the engine) with the strategy and metric(s) as parameters to the constructor.
<5> Pick the data feed you want to use to test your strategy.
<6> Run the back test using the data feed you just created.

The _roboquant_ platform is very flexible and provides many more options than the above example shows. You can easily change almost any aspect of the platform if the default behavior doesn't suit your needs.
