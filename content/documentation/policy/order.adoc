== Order Types
The following diagram shows which orders are supported out of the box:

image::order_types.png[]

All orders refer to a single asset, including advanced order types like BracketOrders. The reason for putting this rule
in place is that real brokers only have limited support for this and could lead to issues that are only discovered during live trading.


== Creating Orders
The policy creates the orders. An example on how to convert signals into simple market orders:

[source, kotlin]
----
val orders = mutableMapOf<Order>()
for (signal in signals) {
    val qty = if (signal.positive) 100.0 else -100.0
    val order = MarketOrder(signal.asset, qty)
    orders.add(order)
}
----


TIP: only use order types during back testing that are also supported by the broker you want to use for live trading.


== TIF
TIF (Time in Force) sets a policy for an order until when the order remains valid. There are two types of TIF:

. Time based, defining how long the order stays valid
. Fill based, defining under what fill conditions the order stays valid

The default TIF is GTC (Goof Till Cancelled)


== Advanced usage
Orders can be easily extended with own order types if the ones that come out of the box are not sufficient. The two steps required to make this possible are:

. Implement the Order abstract class and add the desired logic for your new order type
. Create these new order types in your policy
