== Order Types
The following diagram shows what orders are supported out of the box:

TIP: only use order types during back testing that are also supported by the broker you want to use for live trading.

The policy creates the order. An example how to convert signals into orders:

[source, kotlin]
----
val orders = mutableMapOf<Order>()
for (signal in signals) {
    val qty = if (signal.positive) 100.0 else -100.0
    val order = MarketOrder(signal.asset, qty)
    orders.add(order)
}
----


== TIF
TIF (Time in Force) sets a policy for an order on when the order remains valid. Typically, there are two types of TIF:

. Time based, defining how long the order stays valid
. Fill based, defining under what fill conditions the order stays valid
