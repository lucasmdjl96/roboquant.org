== Order Types
Roboquant comes out of the box with support for different types of orders. The following diagram shows which orders are supported and also their class relationship to each other.

All orders refer to a single asset, including advanced order types like BracketOrders. The reason for putting this restriction
in place is that real brokers only have limited support for multi-asset orders and this could lead to issues that are only discovered during live trading. Additionally, it makes back testing difficult if the price for one asset is known but not for the other.

== Creating Orders
The used `Policy` implementation during a `run` is responsible for creating the orders. This can be based on the received signals from the `Strategy`, but can also be done for other reasons (like for example cyclic portfolio re-balancing)

An example on how to convert a `Signal` into a `MarketOrder`:

include::{sourcefile}[tag=orders]

NOTE: there is no explicit notion of BUY or SELL orders in roboquant. A BUY order is just any order with a positive quantity and a SELL order has a negative quantity. But other than that, they are equal and created the same way.

Most advanced order types are often constructed using `SingleOrder` types. The following snippet shows how to instantiate a BracketOrder with three individual SingleOrders.

TIP: always make sure to only use order types during back testing that are also supported by the broker you want to use for live trading. Also be aware the way these advanced order types are exactly executed might differ between brokers.

== TIF (Time In Force)
TIF sets an execution policy for an order under which conditions the order remains valid. Roughly speaking, there are two types of TIF:

. Time based, defining how long the order stays valid. Two common ones are GTD (Good Till Day) and GTC (Good Till Cancelled)
. Fill based, defining under what fill conditions the order stays valid. A common one if FOK (Fill Or Kill)

The default TIF used if none is specified, is GTC (Good Till Cancelled).



== Custom Order Types
Orders can be extended with your own order types if the ones that come out of the box are not sufficient. The steps required to make to use yor own order types are:

. Extend the `Order` abstract class.
. If you want to use these orders also in back testing, you'll also need to implement and register an OrderHandler

After that, you can use this new order type in your policy.
