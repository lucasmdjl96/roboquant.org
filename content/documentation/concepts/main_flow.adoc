= Main Flow

== Introduction
Perhaps the most important part of using roboquant is to understand the main flow of data and the responsibility each component has in this flow. The following diagram shows all the main components of the platform and the type of data they produce.

NOTE: it is the Roboquant instance that orchestrates the data flow between the components in order to allow for low coupling and easy swapping out of components.

== Responsibilities
The role and responsibilities of each of the components:

* Roboquant
+
The engine of the platform that performs the actual run and orchestrate the interaction between the components. The engine support all xref:four_stages.adoc[four stages] of developing a strategy with minimal change to your code. This is also the only component that is not designed to be swapped out for a custom one.

*  Feed
+
Provides the data needed for testing and trading in the form of events. A feed can represent both historic and live data.

* Strategy
+
Receives events from the feed and generates signals. A signal consist of a rating for a certain asset, like a BUY rating for Tesla. So a strategy doesn't create orders, that is the responsibility of a policy.

* Policy
+
Receives the signals and creates orders.

* Broker
+
Received the orders generated by the policy and process them. Any open orders will also be processed until they are closed. After this step, it will return an updated account that reflects the order and trade status.

* Metric
+
Receives the last state of the account and calculates various metrics that are of interest to determine the progress and results of the run.

* Metrics Logger
+
Stores and/or log the metric values
