== Metric
Receives the last state of the account and calculates various metrics that are of interest to determine the progress and results of the run.

== MetricsLogger
Stores and/or log the calculated metrics.

== Roboquant
The engine of the platform that performs the actual run and orchestrate the interaction between the components. The engine support all xref:four_stages.adoc[four stages] of developing a strategy with minimal change.
