Metrics allow monitoring the progress of a run and get the necessary insights how a strategy id performing. Metrics are not limited to back testing and also be used both during live testing and trading.

The configured metrics are invoked at the end of each step. A single metric can return multiple values, each value has a unique name.

NOTE: metrics only calculate the values, the storing/logging of these values is done by a MetricsLogger.
