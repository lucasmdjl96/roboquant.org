= Metrics Logger
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: rouge

The metrics logger receives the metric values at the end of each step and then stores and/or logs these values.


== Standard Loggers

=== MemoryLogger
This is the default logger used if no other logger is configured

=== SilentLogger
This logger just silently ignores all metrics and is mostly useful for unit tests

=== InfoLogger
Logs metrics using the built-in Logger

=== ConsoleLogger
Logs the metrics to the console using a simple "println" statement.

== Custom Loggers
You can implement also your own MetricsLogger, for example if you want to store values into a database or have some custom file format that you want to use.
