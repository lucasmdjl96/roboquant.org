CSV files are without a doubt the most commonly used format for holding data used for back testing. However, since there is no standard format, they differ a lot.



== Basics
The simplest usage is to provide the directory that contains the CSV files and the CSVFeed will try to parse them based on defaults and the content it finds.

[source, kotlin]
----
val feed = CSVFeed("some/path")
----

== Advanced
Since the format of CSV files differs a lot, the CSVFeed allows for a lot of configuration to cather to this.

The following properties decide on how the CSV files are parsed

[source, properties]
----
asset.type = STOCK
asset.exchange = AEB
asset.currency = EUR

file.extension = csv
file.skip = ABN.csv ASML.csv
----
