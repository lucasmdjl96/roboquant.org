CSV files are one of the most commonly used formats for storing historic price data. However, since there is no standard format, they differ a lot depending on where you downloaded them from.

The CSVFeed class in roboquant offers several configuration options to cather to the different formats.


== Basic usage
The simplest usage is to provide the directory that contains the CSV files and the CSVFeed will try to parse them based on defaults and the content it finds.

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=basic]
----

== Advanced usage
Since the format of CSV files differs a lot, the CSVFeed allows for a lot of configuration to cather to this.

The following properties decide on how the CSV files are parsed

[source, properties]
----
asset.type = STOCK
asset.exchange = AEB
asset.currency = EUR

file.extension = csv
file.skip = ABN.csv ASML.csv
----
