= Crypto

Roboquant supports crypto exchanges in two ways:

. Dedicated support for Binance using their Java client library.
. Support for most other exchanges using the excellent XChange library

== Binance



== Other
Many other crypto exchanges are being integrated using the XChange library. Out of the box, roboquant includes the core libraries, but for connecting to a specific exchange, you'll need to include the client libraries for that exchange.
