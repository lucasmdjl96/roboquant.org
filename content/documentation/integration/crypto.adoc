= Crypto Exchanges
:jbake-date: 2020-01-15

Roboquant supports crypto exchanges in two ways:

. Dedicated support for Binance using their Java client library
. Support for most other exchanges using the excellent XChange library

The module roboquant-crypto contains all the logic, so make sure you include it in your build tool if you want to use it in a standalone application.

== Binance
The roboquant-crypto package contains a dedicated client for Binance.


== Other Exchanges
Many other crypto exchanges are being integrated using the XChange library. Out of the box, roboquant includes the core libraries, but for connecting to a specific exchange, you'll need to include the client libraries for that exchange.
