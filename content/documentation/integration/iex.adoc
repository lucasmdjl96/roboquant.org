IEX Cloud is a financial data platform and provides a variety of datasets, so not only data from the IEX Exchange.

Currently, roboquant integration focuses on price data from IEX Cloud, and not other types of data like fundamental data.

WARNING: IEX Cloud uses a credit system that charges per API call and not a flat fee. So badly written code can quickly consume all your credits.

== Historical data

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=iexhistoric]
----


== Live data

[source, kotlin, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcefile}[tag=iexlive]
----


TIP: IEX Cloud has their own cache that will reduce the number of credits you use when retrieving the same data multiple times. However this data is only cached a certain period. You can also use the Avro capture functionality to record a IEX Cloud Feed (both historic and live) and use that afterwards.
