This feed uses historic data from Yahoo Finance API. Be aware this is not the most stable API and might stop working correctly at any time. However, it is free without the need to even sign up, so it is easy to use and get started.

== Historical data
You can retrieve historical prices based on the assets or symbols. You also need to provide the time-frame you are interested in.

The result is a feed containing price bars (candlesticks) that you can use during back testing.


TIP: An alternative approach to using the YahooHistoricFeed, is to manually download the prices from Yahoo Finance and then
use the CSVFeed to use them in your tests. This has no dependencies on the Yahoo Finance API.
