A strategy is most likely the place where you do most custom development. It is responsible for generating signals based on the events it receives.

== Implementation
You will only need to implement a single method, called ```generate```

== Policy based Strategies
There are use cases that require a strategy not only to have access to the event but also to the account. These type of strategies can be implemented in roboquant, but they should be implemented as a policy and not strategy. Some reasons you might want to use a policy:

* Access to the Account instance is required, for example to re-balance a portfolio
* Directly generate orders instead of signals

See the xref:../policy/index.adoc[policy documentation] for more details.
